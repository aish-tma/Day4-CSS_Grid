            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Diabetes is a chronic,Non communicable,long-term metabolic disease that is typified by high blood sugar. It affects millions of people worldwide and can lead to serious health complications, including heart disease, stroke, kidney failure, and blindness.</p>

            <h2>Working </h2>
            <p> Studies shows that multiple Algorithms are used for diabetes prediction ,using datasets for training models and making predictions. </p>

            <p>The diabetes prediction classifier was developed using an approach described in this chapter. It covers the following topics: preprocessing stages, model selection and implementation, training and evaluation metrics, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model selection and hyper parameter tweaking, and data collection and description.</p>
